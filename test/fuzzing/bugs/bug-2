√ Title
[C-01] A user might join more than once in a game and lose ether forever

√ Invariant
BAL-07: The sum of bets of games should be equal to the fund of contract

√ Description
`joinGameWithEth()` does not check if the game is already joined by another player which can end up with multiple players joining the same game.
RockPaperScissors.sol#L154

√ Impact
If joinGameWithEth(gameId) is called 4 times, the only last user who joins the game will be considered as a player. The first, second and third users will lose their ether forever.
It will be locked in the contract.

√ Recommendation
Check whether the game has two players. If it has, revert the transaction.
